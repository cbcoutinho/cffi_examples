# CFFI Examples combining C, Fortran, Rust and Python

This is a repository for my own reference showing how you can combine code written in different languages through their respective C-language bindings.

Some of the examples are used to created shared libraries that can be later called using python. The examples using python use either the cffi and ctypes modules.

I owe a great amount of thanks to various online sources:
